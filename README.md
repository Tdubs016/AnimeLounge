# Building and Running

you will need to setup your own mySQL for the database stuff to work since I don't it on the web

will need socket.io dependencies to connect to server

will need json dependencies for api to function

will also need to install node js to run the server on your home device since it is not on the web

also uses anime db as the api

Should run perfectly fine on java netbeans.
